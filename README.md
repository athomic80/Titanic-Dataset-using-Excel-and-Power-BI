# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis Project 🧳

## 📊 Overview

Welcome to the **Titanic Data Analysis** project. In this project, I take a close look at the **Titanic dataset**, which contains information about the passengers aboard the **RMS Titanic**, and analyze the data using **Excel** and **Power BI**. The goal is to better understand factors that influenced survival chances during the tragic **Titanic** disaster. 🌊

### 🎯 What we're doing:
- Exploring the **Titanic dataset** to uncover patterns and insights regarding passengers' survival.
- Cleaning and analyzing the data in **Excel**.
- Creating informative **visualizations** in **Power BI** to highlight important trends, such as how survival rates differed by class, gender, age, and embarkation port.

## 📝 Reflection
This project was a valuable learning experience in data analysis and visualization, using the Titanic dataset to explore key patterns and insights. By working with Excel and Power BI, I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation, and creating interactive visualizations. Analyzing factors like survival rates, gender, class, and age not only deepened my understanding of the data but also highlighted the real-world implications behind the numbers. This project reinforced the importance of storytelling through data and gave me a deeper appreciation for how data visualization can make complex historical events more accessible and meaningful.
